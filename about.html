<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, I am Shahin Tadvi. I am learning Web Developing for myself. I am a Housewife living in Mumbai, India. I love learning and working coding. I find coding very interesting and i think every one should give it a try atleast. </p>

<p>Coding has always amused me before but after trying and learning it, it boosts logical thinking and problem solving skills in me. It provides the ability to think differently for me. In future atleast i'll know or understand what goes behind a particular website or any program and how it works. My Vocabulary and grammar is not so good but i like to give my 100% in everything. And i am looking forward to try and give my best in this course as well.</p>

<p>Also, as i can see programmers are constantly in high demand nowadays that is also an another reason of me to learn and work in this field. It will also offer me career opportunities in future. I think this is the best possible way to upgrade or upskill myself at the comfort of my home without compromising with my other busy schedule and looking after my son. So, why not.</p>
